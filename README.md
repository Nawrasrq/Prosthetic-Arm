# Prosthetic-Arm
Personal project aimed at designing a low budget prosthetic arm using actuators and servos

To Do:
  - Research power supply and figure out how to regulate it to power Arduino and actuators. Need 5V for arduino uno and servos and 6V for actuators. EMG sensor should be fine         with 5V
  - Test out EMG sensor and observe output to learn how best to control servos and actuators
  - Design actual arm using AutoCad
    - Hand to wrist need to be made to be easily attachable and modular
