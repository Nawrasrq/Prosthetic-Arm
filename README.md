# Prosthetic-Arm
Personal project aimed at designing a low budget prosthetic arm using actuators and servos
To Do:
  -Research power supply and figure out how to regulate it to power Arduino and actuators. (need 5V for arduino uno and servos and 6V for actuators)
  -Test out EMG sensor and observe output to learn how best to control servos and actuators
  -Design actual arm
    >Hand to wrist need to be made to be easily attachable and modular
